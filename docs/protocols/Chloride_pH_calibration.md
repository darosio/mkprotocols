# Chloride and pH calibration in Hek cells

## Materials

Ensure the following materials are available before starting the procedure:

- Transfection kit: Qiagen Effectene
- Plasmid DNA: Midi or mini transfection-grade

## Procedure

- `Day 1 - Cell Seeding`

    1. Seed 25,000 HEK cells per well in a Labtec chamber with 0.5 mL of culture
       medium.

- `Day 2: Transfection (6-hour protocol)`

    1. Mix 0.3 µg of DNA with 50 µL EC buffer in a clean microcentrifuge tube.
    2. Add 2.4 µL of Enhancer, vortex gently, and incubate for 5 minutes at room
       temperature.
    3. Add 4 µL of Effectene, mix thoroughly, and incubate for 10 minutes at
       room temperature.
    4. Add the transfection mixture to the cells dropwise and incubate for 6 hours.

    |             | 1 well | … wells |
    | ----------- | ------ | ------- |
    | Plasmid DNA | 0.3 µg |         |
    | Enhancer    | 2.4 µL |         |
    | EC buffer   | 50 µL  |         |
    | Effectene   | 4 µL   |         |

- `Days 3 & 4: Chloride and pH Calibration`

    1. Remove medium from one well carefully.
    2. Add 1 mL of the desired buffer containing ionophores (prepared fresh).
    3. Incubate the cells for 2 minutes, then change the buffer. Repeat this
       process 4 times.
    4. Begin imaging cells for chloride or pH calibration after buffer changes.
    5. For wells that are not being imaged immediately, add a drop of 50 mM Tris
       (pH 7.3) to maintain the cells.

## Notes

- Ensure that buffers with ionophores are freshly prepared and kept at
  appropriate pH levels.
- Imaging should be performed promptly after the buffer changes to ensure
  accuracy in pH and chloride calibration.
