# Sample Protocol

## Overview

This sample protocol is designed as a template for documenting laboratory
procedures.

Each protocol in this repository is intended to be well-documented,
reproducible, and includes necessary materials, step-by-step instructions, and
troubleshooting tips.

## Materials

Ensure the following materials are available before starting the procedure:

- Material 1: [Provide description or specifications if necessary]
- Material 2: [Provide description or specifications if necessary]

|             | 1 well | … wells |
| ----------- | ------ | ------- |
| Plasmid DNA | 0.3 µg |         |

## Procedure

Follow these steps to complete the protocol:

1. Step One: Brief description of the first step. Include specific measurements, time points, or other details where relevant.
2. Step Two: Brief description of the second step. Add any additional details necessary to complete the protocol.

### Example Code

In some protocols, you may need to run computational tasks. Below is a sample Python code snippet:

```python
import numpy as np

array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(array)
```

## Notes and troubleshooting

If issues arise during the protocol, refer to the following common troubleshooting tips:

- Issue 1: Potential problem and its solution.
- Issue 2: Potential problem and its solution.
