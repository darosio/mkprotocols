# Welcome to the Lab Protocols Documentation

This repository contains a collection of standardized laboratory protocols for various molecular biology and biophysical experiments. The protocols are organized into different categories and can be easily accessed via the navigation menu.

Our goal is to provide well-documented, reproducible procedures that can be easily shared and collaboratively improved. Each protocol includes detailed instructions, required materials, and troubleshooting tips.

## Getting Started

To get started, browse the available protocols from the navigation menu. If you're new to the repository, here are some useful guidelines:

- **How to Use**: Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in each protocol. Most protocols include recommended reagents, necessary equipment, and expected outcomes.
- **Contributing**: If you'd like to contribute a new protocol or improve an existing one, please follow the contribution guidelines. You can submit a pull request with your changes.

## Available Protocols

Here is a list of the available protocols:

- **[PCR Protocol](protocols/Sample_protocol.md)**: Learn how to amplify DNA sequences with polymerase chain reaction.
- **[Titration](protocols/Titration_in_cells.md)**: Follow this protocol to extract DNA from biological samples.

More protocols will be added as we continue to expand this collection.

## Why This Documentation?

Reproducibility and transparency are critical in scientific research. By organizing and sharing protocols through this repository, we aim to:

1. Facilitate consistent execution of experiments across team members and collaborators.
2. Allow continuous improvement and version control of protocols.
3. Make it easier to document any modifications or new techniques.

## Feedback and Suggestions

We value feedback and suggestions to improve this documentation. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for additional protocols, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
